# Methodology Assignment 5


**Name:** Hovhannes Broyan  
**Email:** hbroyan@ucsd.edu  
**Section:** Modeling Mental Health with Mobile and Wearable Data  
**Mentor:** Tauhidur Rahman  
  
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
We have discussed working with facial recognition models to classify people's emotions.  
  
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Examine children's facial expressions and use that in order to see how they react to different environments.  
Possibly predict whether a child has a weak/strong grasp on their emotions and how prone they are to different
mental health problems.  
  
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
We are currently working with OpenFace for our facial recognition needs, however, a potential change may occur  
in which facial recognition library we use. Possibly DeepFace or a pytorch vision model.  
  
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in not only processing image data for features but possibly to look into mp4 data to get auditory  
data as well.
